# Random-User-API-Tests

Sample application using the data returned by: https://randomuser.me/documentation

This project will utilize a single seed for all data pulls 

## To Do:

0) Setup all dependencies (likely just using normal Utils)
1) Make networking class
2) Make networking interface + api calls for simplicity
3) Make pojos for data model mapping
4) Design UI
    - 1 activity + 2 fragments
    - 1st Frag will be recyclerview for returned data list
    - 2nd Frag will be 'profile' style view for indiv data
5) Setup data persist (likely just use normal utils here too)
6) Setup recyclerview adapter for clean look 
7) Design simple link listener to communicate betwen frags and activity
8) Setup Constants class for all tags and strings to use (omitting r.string for this project for simplicity)
9) If time is left, setup animations on loaders
10) Use custom Progress bar loader (normal utils)
